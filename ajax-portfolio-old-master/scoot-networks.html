				<h1>An innovative product that leaves users wanting more</h1>
				<p>There are a lot of options for getting around San Francisco. Each day thousdands of people use their bikes, public transportation, taxi services, or their own vehicle to get around. Biking is a great thing and I admire people who treck up and down the San Francisco hills in the name of exercise and the environment, all of you are great people. As noble as biking can be, it’s not always the best mode of transportation. Showing up to a shower-less office isn’t always the most enjoyable experience and let’s not forget to daily ritual of patting down the lower back and armpits with copious amounts of paper towels. It can start to get old after awhile…I’ve been there. It’s even worse using your bosses bathroom at the office party. Public transportation is great if you’re living on the cheap and don’t mind waiting for a bus. But once you’ve stepped onto a MUNI bus, the transit can be painfully slow, uncomfortable, and plain boring. If you want to get somewhere fast, transportation networks like Lyft and Sidecar are reliable and if used conservatively, they won’t burn a hole in your pocket. If you’re lucky enough to own a car (or have an awesome roommate with a car), then you can get your destination even faster; however, it’s no secret that parking in city can be worse than watching a football game with Seahawks fans. Along with very limited spaces, the cost of parking is never pleasant.  Although each mode of transportation it’s benefits, there doesn’t seem to a clear winner when it comes to cost efficiency, rate of transit, and enjoyability. Scoot Networks (or Scoot), a 2-year old shared electric moped company, has stepped up and created a brilliant solution that allows users to zip around the city in zero-emissions scooters and...</p>

				<p>I love Scoot. I think it’s an amazing concept and I’ve been a faithful user for several months. They have a very hard working team, briliiant engineers, and their customer service should be appaulded. Having said that, the interface and product needs improvement. There are several missing features and design problems that make the app clumsy and difficult to navigate. As an MVP, it does a sufficient job. It allows the user to complete their task…getting from A to B; however when a user seeks more information and content, the lack of hierachy and unpredictable design makes it difficult for users to complete tasks.</p>
